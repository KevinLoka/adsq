The logic followed to complete the project

We have  those categories
1. users
2. stores
3. signals

The solution was as followed:
1. Create a standart table for all the users
2. Format signals and stores in computable format
3. Join signals and stores if their coordinates matches
4. Join the full client information with signals based on their ids
5. Do the calculations after the joins are done
